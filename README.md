# Happymodel-Mobula-8-1s-battery-shim

This model allows for a 1s 450mah battery to friction fit into the 2s Mobula 8 battery tray while tucking an XT 30 addapter underslung within the original Mobula 8 battery tray.

I printed in TPU with 15% infil.

I was a little tempted to add a positive retention system to clip into the lower supports of Mobula 8 battery tray but so far I have not found that to be needed.
